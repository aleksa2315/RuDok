# RuDok
RuDok is an application that is used to handle(create and edit) documents(presentations). The idea was to create something like PowerPoint but wiht fewer functions. A documents consists of a workspace, which have presentations in them, further, a presentation consists of slides and every slide can have elements in it. Every slide has a background which can be changed. You can put the application into presentation mode in which you can cycle through. There is a feature which lets you share a slide between two presentations and the changes dynamically show in every copy of that slide.
